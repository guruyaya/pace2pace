# Pace2Pace
Pace to pace is a simple, yet powerful way to conduct authentication, and link to services on a P2P basis.

## How it works?
The protocol is based on ideas used by OPENID V1.0. B×˜ that I mean - the basis is claiming a URL. However, instead of using an external service to authenticate - it will provide the users PUBLIC KEY. That means the process of authentication is not done on a separate server, but on the app doing the authentication. This means at no point, you need to trust an external service to handle the authentication.

## Protocol Definition
While I find the details on this stage kinda fuzzy, I am expecting the first protocol to use to following meta tags:

"pace2pace-version" (will start with "0.1a")

"pace2pace-key-protocol" (At this point pace2pace will support only "GPG" keys)

"pace2pace-key" (the user public key)

"pace2pace-timestamp" (last change timestamp)

"pace2pace-service-[service name]" (I expect future development of the protocol, will lead to development of serivce providers, that will ride on it's possibilities to provide services. This tag will be kept open to allow services)

"pace2pace-delegate" (allows a user to delegate the page to another service)

The authentaction process goes as follows:
1. The user that wishes to authenticate, contacts the service, giving the page
2. In a normal course of operation, the service try to read the remote page to get the key. However the service can cache keys, or decide that the key looks suspicious for some reason.
3. The service will provide the user with a random string it generated, and ask to get it encoded, with the end user private key
4. The user will return the encoded string
5. The service will see that the provided string, after decoding, matches the random string it sent, thous proving the user had access to the private key, thous claiming ownership of the URL

## TODO
1. Create a Python implementation of the server side authentication process
2. Create a JAVA implementation of the server side authentication process
3. Create a separate project as a web service that will allow Simple Pace2Pace auth pages
4. Defining issues of page validation by other user, and revoking keys when compremised.
